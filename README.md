# üåç NovaSphere - 3D Geospatial Visualizer

A visually stunning, interactive 3D globe of Earth, built with React-Three-Fiber (WebGL) and TypeScript. This project demonstrates the power of modern web technologies to create immersive, data-driven, 3D experiences directly in the browser.

## ‚ú® Key Features
Photorealistic 3D Earth: Renders a high-resolution sphere with detailed textures for day, night (with city lights), and a dynamic cloud layer.

Interactive Exploration: Full camera control allows users to intuitively orbit, zoom, and pan around the globe with the mouse.

Cinematic "Fly-To" Animations: The camera smoothly animates to center on any selected country, creating a cinematic user experience.

Live Data Integration: Fetches and displays up-to-date information for each country by connecting to a live public API.

Data Visualization Layer: Features the ability to plot data points (like major cities) directly onto the 3D surface of the globe.

Immersive UI: A sleek, "glassmorphism" UI overlay for displaying information without obstructing the view.
